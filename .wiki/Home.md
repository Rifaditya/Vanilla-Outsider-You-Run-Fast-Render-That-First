## 🧭 Welcome to the Official Documentation

**Vanilla Outsider: You Run Fast, Render That First** is an ultra-high-performance Fabric optimization mod designed to eliminate high-speed chunk pop-in and void walls. By synchronizing client chunk render meshing queues and server world generation tickets directly with the player's real-time velocity vector ($\vec{v}$), the terrain you are flying or galloping toward is compiled and loaded first.

## ⚡ Key Architectural Subsystems

Every supported version features four dedicated subsystem engineering domains:

1. **[[Anisotropic Chunk Prioritization|26.3-Anisotropic-Prioritization]]**:
   Replaces vanilla's Euclidean radial sorting with directional dot-product distance calculation. Chunks in your trajectory vector receive dramatically reduced distance scores, forcing chunk compile worker threads to mesh forward terrain first.

2. **[[Predictive Chunk Generation Biasing|26.3-Chunk-Generation-Biasing]]**:
   Server-side trajectory raycaster that allocates temporary `PLAYER_LOADING` tickets along your forward velocity cone. Coupled with the Continuous MSPT Watchdog, it adapts lookahead reach from 4 to 16 chunks to preserve 20 TPS.

3. **[[Dynamic Configuration & GameRules|26.3-Configuration-and-GameRules]]**:
   Full real-time in-game control via namespaced `yourunfast:*` GameRules and the `/yourunfast` Brigadier command suite (`help`, `status`, `get`, `set`, `reset`, `reload`).

4. **[[Technical Architecture & Mixins|26.3-Architecture-and-Mixins]]**:
   Deep technical breakdown of package architectures, zero-allocation primitive FastUtil collections, volatile cache variables, and version-specific Mixin targets.
