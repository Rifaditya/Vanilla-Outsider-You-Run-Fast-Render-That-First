```

1. **Velocity Sampling & Player Evaluation**:
   - Registered to `ServerTickEvents.END_SERVER_TICK`.
   - Each player's coordinate movement is evaluated via `VelocityCalculator`.
   - Players moving below `min_speed_threshold` ($0.20\text{ b/t}$) have all prediction tickets pruned immediately.
2. **Spatial & Angular Throttling**:
   - Recalculation occurs **only** when one of three conditions is met:
     1. Player crossed a chunk boundary (`currentChunkPacked != lastChunk`).
     2. Player rotated yaw by more than $8.0^\circ$ (`|currentYaw - lastYaw| > 8.0f`).
     3. 10 ticks have elapsed since last calculation ($0.5\text{ seconds}$).
   - This reduces ticket recalculation frequency by over $85\%$, eliminating server tick overhead.
3. **Continuous MSPT Watchdog Tapering**:
   - The server samples tick duration in nanoseconds.
   - If MSPT exceeds $25.0\text{ ms}$, lookahead reach is smoothly tapered downward to protect 20 TPS.
4. **Trajectory Waypoint Generation & Fan-Out**:
   - Waypoints are calculated in steps of 2 chunks along the horizontal unit vector.
   - At high speed ($s \ge 0.80\text{ b/t}$), banked flight lateral chunks are added to account for steering.
5. **Dimension Switch & Disconnect Safety**:
   - `ServerPlayConnectionEvents.DISCONNECT` and dimension change listeners immediately release all held tickets, preventing memory leaks and orphaned chunk generation tasks.

## 3. Mathematical Formulas & Ticket Dynamics

### Continuous MSPT Watchdog Scaling Factor
$$\text{mspt} = \frac{\text{averageTickTimeNanos}}{1000000.0}$$

$$\text{msptFactor} = \begin{cases} 1.0 & \text{if } \text{mspt} \le 25.0 \\ \max\left(0.25,\, 1.0 - \frac{\text{mspt} - 25.0}{25.0}\right) & \text{if } \text{mspt} > 25.0 \end{cases}$$

### Dynamic Lookahead Reach Formula
$$\text{leadScale} = \frac{\text{forwardLeadMultiplier}}{100.0}$$

$$\text{maxAllowedReach} = \max\left(4,\, \text{round}(16.0 \times \text{leadScale} \times \text{msptFactor})\right)$$

$$\text{dynamicReach} = \min\left(\text{maxAllowedReach},\, \text{round}(s \times 8.0 \times \text{leadScale} \times \text{msptFactor})\right)$$

### Trajectory Raycast Waypoints
Given player chunk coordinates $(X_{\text{player}}, Z_{\text{player}})$ and normalized horizontal velocity vector $(\hat{v}_x, \hat{v}_z)$:

$$\text{targetX}(k) = X_{\text{player}} + \text{round}(\hat{v}_x \cdot k)$$

$$\text{targetZ}(k) = Z_{\text{player}} + \text{round}(\hat{v}_z \cdot k)$$

$$\text{for } k \in \{2, 4, 6, \dots, \text{dynamicReach}\} $$

### Lateral Fan-Out Equations (For Banked Turns at High Speed)
When $s \ge 0.80\text{ b/t}$ and $k \ge 6$:

$$\text{LeftWaypoint} = \left(\text{targetX}(k) - \text{round}(\hat{v}_z),\, \text{targetZ}(k) + \text{round}(\hat{v}_x)\right)$$

$$\text{RightWaypoint} = \left(\text{targetX}(k) + \text{round}(\hat{v}_z),\, \text{targetZ}(k) - \text{round}(\hat{v}_x)\right)$$

## 5. FastUtil Zero-Allocation Primitive Bit-Packing Schema

Coordinate pairs $(x, z)$ are packed into a single 64-bit primitive `long`:

```
Bit-Packing Format (64-bit Long):
[63 ................................... 32] [31 .................................... 0]
                 Z (32-bit signed)                          X (32-bit signed)
```

$$\text{packedPos} = ((x \,\&\, \text{0xFFFFFFFFL})) \mid (((z \,\&\, \text{0xFFFFFFFFL})) \ll 32)$$

Stored in FastUtil `LongOpenHashSet`:
- Zero heap allocation per check.
- Zero object boxing overhead (no `java.lang.Long`).
- Lock-free memory overhead footprint.

## 7. Developer & API Hooks

### Public Telemetry & Status Facade
```java
// Access active player telemetry
int activeTickets = ForwardTicketManager.getActiveTicketCount(player.getUUID());
double currentSpeed = ForwardTicketManager.getPlayerSpeed(player.getUUID());
int currentReach = ForwardTicketManager.getLastDynamicReach();
float currentMspt = ForwardTicketManager.getLastServerMspt();
```

### Event Handlers
- `ForwardTicketManager.tickPlayer(ServerPlayer player)`: Called per tick per player.
- `ForwardTicketManager.onPlayerDisconnect(ServerPlayer player)`: Prunes all allocated tickets.
- `ForwardTicketManager.onPlayerChangeDimension(ServerPlayer player)`: Clears dimensional tickets.
